## Project Overview

GadgetHeaven is a modern e-commerce platform for purchasing gadgets. The site includes structured navigation, product categories, individual product detail pages, and interactive features such as a shopping cart and wishlist system. Users can manage their cart and wishlist, sort items by price, and experience a seamless UI with persistent data handling.

## React Fundamentals Used

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements for modular code structure.
- **Props**: Data is passed between components to maintain dynamic rendering.
- **State Management**: Utilized React's `useState` and `useEffect` to manage UI interactions.
- **React Router**: Implemented for navigation between different pages.
- **Context API**: Used for centralized state management of cart and wishlist data.

## Data Handling & Management

- **Context API**: Manages cart and wishlist data globally across the application.
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist user data even after page reloads.

## Key Features

1. **Shopping Cart System**: Users can add/remove items, view total price, and manage purchases.
2. **Wishlist System**: Allows users to save items for future reference.
3. **Sort by Price**: Users can sort products in descending order based on price.
4. **Product Filtering**: Users can browse items based on different categories.
5. **Persistent Data Handling**: Ensures cart and wishlist data remain even after a refresh using Local Storage.
